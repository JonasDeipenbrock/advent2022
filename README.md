AdventOfCode 2022

My solutions to this years advent of code. Main focus is getting better with python and using a lot of the different tools that python offers aswell as trying to write
clean and understandable code.

For some days my solution includes a `short.py` which are my personal tries at a very short solution for that particular day.
